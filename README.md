# WordOD - Word of the Day
WordOD is a Discord bot that sends a new word of the day every morning. The bot is designed to help users expand their vocabulary and learn new words daily. The bot sends the word of the day along with its definition, part of speech, and an example sentence for context.

## How it Works
This is a small web scraping project built using Python and hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The bot retrieves the word of the day from https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/.<br>Once the word is retrieved, the bot sends it to a designated Discord channel using Discord's API.

## Usage
WordOD is designed to be easy to use. Simply contact me to be apart of the Discord server and you will start receiving the word of the day every morning.
